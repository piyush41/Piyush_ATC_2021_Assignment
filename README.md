# Piyush_ATC_2021_Assignment

For running the program Jupyter notebook, after that compiling the program, we have to give the inputs in line by line format
for eg:=
Not(And(x1+x2==10,x2==6))
2
15
2
where the first line represents the atomic formula, and then in the second line, we have to put the number of variables and the value of those variables in the next n lines.

NOTE-> input has to be in the same order that we have given input. which is increasing order of xi's, And in the output of And  function table has
(a,b) where a corresponds to the state in  second argument and b in the first argument.And also i have defined x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6 only so if you want to more variables than just defined it globally.

Please check final_ouput, in other file i have not take of all the cases when we call nested and's with different xi's

Thanks for reading this, Have a good day
